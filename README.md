# Dysolving Dyslexia with AI Intelligent Systems

## Overview and Origin

1. ### Company Name:  [`EduNational`](https://dysolve.com/edunational/)

1. ### Incorporation: 
    - EduNational LLC was [incorporated in New York in 2007](https://www.dysolve.com/wp-content/themes/dysolve/images/EduNational-Backgrounder-1.pdf) as a certified MWOSB (minority women-owned small business), to meet the needs of neurodiverse students. In 2017 the company broadened its services to individuals with dyslexia with the Dysolve Program.

1. ### Founders:  
    - EduNational LLC was originally [founded in 2007 by Dr. Coral PS Hoh](https://www.dysolve.com/wp-content/themes/dysolve/images/EduNational-Backgrounder-1.pdf), as a consultancy, to address the needs of neurodiverse individuals.  
    - In 2017, [Dr. Hoh partnered with Evan Haruta](https://www.dysolve.com/wp-content/themes/dysolve/images/EduNational-Backgrounder-1.pdf) to transform the company into an AI-driven firm.  This transition enabled the company to broaden its services to individuals with dyslexia by creating the Dysolve Program.  

1. ### Origin: 
    - The idea for Dysolve emerged from Dr. Hoh's extensive research into neurological conditions.  As a consultancy, EduNational's initial focus was on designing intervention programs for special education.  It later evolved into an AI firm, to build AI systems to address learning disabilities, like dyslexia.

1. ### Funding:
    - The company is primarily funded through [monthly subscriptions](https://dysolve.com/programsss/#what_dysolve_costs) from their customers at $222 for the Basic plan and $389 for the Premier plan.

## Business Activities

1. ### Problem Statement:
    - Dysolve AI aims to streamline the process of evaluating and addressing dyslexia by leveraging the power of AI to overcome the three [traditional challenges](https://www.smartbrief.com/original/how-ai-can-revolutionize-dyslexia-education-more):
        - `Complexity of the human brain`: Dyslexia and other language-based disorders involve processing deficits in the linguistic system that are impossible for humans to locate.
        - `Speed of language processing` : Human evaluators cannot measure brain processes that occur in hundreds of milliseconds in parallel.
        - `Capacity to serve one and all students` : Teachers cannot track all errors made by a student throughout their program to locate their sources and correct them.
     > "A traditional evaluation [costs] between $5,000-$10,000 per child.  [With Dysolve] every session...is [an] evaluation.  Schools can only [evaluate performance] at the beginning.  That's why there is a disconnect between the child's [previous performance] and new issues [that] come up." - [Dr. Coral PS Hoh, Co-founder of Dysolve AI](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2024/07/03/can-ai-change-the-brain-co-founder-behind-revolutionary-dyslexia-treatment-says-yes/) 
1. ### Intended Customer:
    - The software is designed for individuals experiencing difficulty reading due to dyslexia, and other learning disorders.  Statistics indicate [one in five people in the United States have dyslexia](https://youtu.be/MRVK5boZriI).  That accounts for roughly 20% of the U.S. population, equivalent to approximately 66.8 million people.

1. ### Competitive Advantage:
    - Dysolve sets itself apart with its personalized, game-based intervention programs, crafted through AI-driven assessments of the learner's language processing abilities during each session.
    > "When a person plays a game, certain targeted brain processes are activated for analysis. Which processes ran efficiently, and which ones did not? At what level of efficiency? This autonomous AI system delivers online games continuously to a person with dyslexia, using previous gameplay data to build the next game." - [Dr. Coral PS Hoh, Co-founder of Dysolve AI](https://builtin.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-and-dyslexia)

1. ### Current Technologies
    - Dysolve AI is a proprietary program that was uniquely designed over the past 10 years, prior to the availability of commercial AI products like OpenAI or Microsoft Azure AI services. [The system has been meticulously trained on national dyslexia databases and educational data compiled from diverse populations over several decades.](https://www.technewsworld.com/story/ai-powered-software-offers-breakthrough-for-treating-dyslexia-178937.html) Dysolve AI begins by assessing the user's linguistic abilities through their responses to a series of short, interactive games. Upon identifying specific linguistic deficits, the Dysolve AI model generates personalized follow-up games designed to target and remediate those issues. Each session serves as a continuous learning opportunity for the AI, enabling it to refine its approach and create an evolving game-based remediation strategy tailored to the individual needs of each user.
## Landscape

1.  ### Company Field:
    - EduNational is in the field of education (EdTech) and healthcare.  The company focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) for diagnosing and treating language-related disorders such as dyslexia and other related conditions. 
1.  ### Major Industry Trends:
    - Over the past decade students suspected of having reading disability were required to be [screened for dyslexia](https://observer.com/2024/09/new-yorks-dyslexia-bill-how-ai-can-transform-special-education-and-save-billions/), in order to be enrolled in limited special education programs.  However, since schools already administer standardized reading assessments on a quarterly basis, a better solution would be to provide intervention for students performing in the bottom third on standardized tests.
    - [Human linguistics is a complex, interlocking system](https://observer.com/2024/09/new-yorks-dyslexia-bill-how-ai-can-transform-special-education-and-save-billions/) that requires constant encoding and decoding during the communication process.  It is nearly impossible to detect a deficit in this process through human intervention.  However, the adoption of AI in educational tools has revolutionized personalized learning experiences, making real-time assessment and customized lesson plans possible.  
    
    
    > "In recent years, AI’s ability to find patterns and develop personalized treatments and solutions has surpassed the skills of human practitioners."

## Results

1.  ### Business Impact:
    - EduNational has significantly influenced the education and healthcare sectors since its transition into an AI firm, achieving notable success despite being relatively small in size. It has reported between 1 to 5 million annual revenue since inception, despite having only 18 employees. EduNational continues to bring social awareness to the financial burden that outdated screening policies are placing on families and school districts.  For instance, Ortan Gillingham (OG/MLS) is a popular dyslexia intervention program, in the U.S.  In some states teachers are required to receive special training and certifications in this method, despite the lack of evidence to support the long-term efficacy of the program.  Dysolve has positioned itself as a cost-effective solution that can transform the Special Education system.  Case studies have proven academic performance gains within two months of program completion, at [1% of the cost per student in New York, and under 10% of special education cost in state funding](https://observer.com/2024/09/new-yorks-dyslexia-bill-how-ai-can-transform-special-education-and-save-billions/).

1.  ### Core Success Metrics:
    - According to [Zippia](https://www.zippia.com/carnegie-learning-careers-1012517/revenue/), the key financial metrics for Carnegie Learning's performance are peak revenue and revenue per employee ratio.  Although [EduNational's 2.6m in revenue](https://zi-lite.zoominfo.com/#/profile/company/1334565411/overview) is a fraction of Carnegie Learning's 22.4m 2023 revenue, EduNational's revenue per employee outperforms Carnegie Learnings, which emphasizes its efficiency and impact relative to its size.  Carnegie Learnings revenue per 615 employees is 36,439, while EduNational's revenue per [18 employees](https://www.zoominfo.com/c/edunational-llc/1334565411) is 145k.

1.  ### Industry Performance:
    - EduNational is performing well in the intelligent systems field with a reported 2.6 million in revenue for 2023.  In terms of overall profits EduNational is ranked third place in comparison to top competitors, such as [Carnegie Learning with 22.4m](https://www.zippia.com/carnegie-learning-careers-1012517/revenue/) and [LiteracyPlanet with 4.7m](https://zi-lite.zoominfo.com/#/profile/company/354456212/overview) in reported revenue.
    - Despite its relatively small marketshare, EduNational has managed to distiguish itself from Carnegie Learning, by emphasizing its dynamic game-based approach to detection and treatment, which creates a personalized treatment plan.
## Recommendations

1.  ### Products and Services Expansion:
    - EduNational should consider expanding to become the leader in special education intervention from K-12.  As such, it should incorporate products to treat comorbid conditions such as dyscalcula or dysgraphia, which also affects individuals with dyslexia.  
1.  ### Expansion Benefits:
    -  Expanding into treatments for related conditions would not only generate a new revenue stream, but also strengthen the company's position as a leader in comprehensive AI-based learning support.
1.  ### Required Technologies for Expansion:
    - The product would not require any new technologies, instead it would be an extension of the current technology to improve cognitive processes for a different type of disorder.  However, additional research would be required to identify appropriate evaluation and remediation metrics.
1.  ### Expansion Assumptions:
    - Dysolve has proven itself to be an effective tool to identify deficiencies in linguistic processes, by targeting underlying issues.  It can be reasonably assumed that a similar approach would be effective in correcting problems with fine motor skills, in addition to spatial and numerical reasoning.
