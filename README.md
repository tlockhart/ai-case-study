# Dysolving Dyslexia with AI Intelligent Systems

## Overview and Origin

1. ### Company Name:  [`EduNational`](https://dysolve.com/edunational/)

1. ### Origin: 
    - The idea for EduNational emerged from Dr. Coral PS Hoh's extensive research into neurological conditions. Dr. Hoh is a clinical linguist, who has over 30 years of experience working with students with special needs.  EduNational LLC was originally [founded](https://www.dysolve.com/wp-content/themes/dysolve/images/EduNational-Backgrounder-1.pdf) as a consultancy in 2007 by Dr. Hoh.  As a consultancy, its primary objective was to design intervention programs for special education.  It was [incorporated](https://www.dysolve.com/wp-content/themes/dysolve/images/EduNational-Backgrounder-1.pdf) in New York in 2007 as a certified MWOSB (minority women-owned small business). However, in 2017, Dr. Hoh partnered with [co-founder Evan Haruta](https://www.dysolve.com/wp-content/themes/dysolve/images/EduNational-Backgrounder-1.pdf) to transform the company into an AI-driven firm. Mr. Haruta is a software engineer with over 30 years of experience in large mainframe computing.  This new leadership enabled the company to broaden its services to individuals with dyslexia by creating the Dysolve Program.

1. ### Funding:
    - Dr. Hoh's research on the linguistic abilities of neurodiverse individuals was funded by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.dysolve.com/wp-content/themes/dysolve/images/EduNational-Backgrounder-1.pdf). 
        - [`Neurodiversity`](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-is-neurodiversity-202111232645) - Refers to the differences in how people interact with the world.  "It is often used in the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as other neurological or developmental conditions such as ADHD or learning disabilities." 
    - This research later led to the development of patented computing technologies for the diagnosis and treatment of language-related disorders, which have been integrated into the Dysolve AI system. Currently, the company is primarily funded through [monthly subscriptions](https://dysolve.com/programsss/#what_dysolve_costs) to the Dysolve Program.  The programs are categorized into three plans:
        - **Basic Plan:** $222 
        - **Premier Plan:** $389
        - **Individual Plan:** Tailored to individual needs

## Business Activities

1. ### Problem Statement:
    - Dysolve AI aims to streamline the process of evaluating and addressing dyslexia by leveraging the power of AI to overcome the three [traditional challenges](https://www.smartbrief.com/original/how-ai-can-revolutionize-dyslexia-education-more):
        - `Complexity of the human brain`: "Dyslexia and other language-based disorders involve processing deficits in the linguistic system that are impossible for humans to locate."
        - `Speed of language processing`: "Human evaluators cannot measure brain processes that occur in hundreds of milliseconds in parallel."
        - `Capacity to serve one and all students`: "Teachers cannot track all errors made by a student throughout their program to locate their sources and correct them."
     > "A traditional evaluation [costs] between $5,000-$10,000 per child.  [With Dysolve] every session...is [an] evaluation.  Schools can only [evaluate performance] at the beginning.  That's why there is a disconnect between the child's [previous performance] and new issues [that] come up." - [Dr. Coral PS Hoh, Co-founder of Dysolve AI](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2024/07/03/can-ai-change-the-brain-co-founder-behind-revolutionary-dyslexia-treatment-says-yes/) 
1. ### Intended Customer:
    - The software is designed for individuals having trouble reading due to dyslexia, and other learning disorders.  Statistics indicate [one in five people in the United States have dyslexia](https://youtu.be/MRVK5boZriI).  That accounts for roughly 20% of the U.S. population, equivalent to approximately 66.8 million people.

1. ### Competitive Advantage:
    - Dysolve sets itself apart with its personalized, game-based intervention programs, crafted through AI-driven assessments of the learner's language processing abilities during each session.
    > "When a person plays a game, certain targeted brain processes are activated for analysis. Which processes ran efficiently, and which ones did not? At what level of efficiency? This autonomous AI system delivers online games continuously to a person with dyslexia, using previous gameplay data to build the next game." - [Dr. Coral PS Hoh, Co-founder of Dysolve AI](https://builtin.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-and-dyslexia)

1. ### Current Technologies
    - Dysolve AI is a proprietary program that was uniquely designed over the past 10 years, prior to the availability of commercial AI products like OpenAI or Microsoft Azure AI services. [The system has been meticulously trained](https://www.technewsworld.com/story/ai-powered-software-offers-breakthrough-for-treating-dyslexia-178937.html) on national dyslexia databases and educational data compiled from diverse populations over several decades. Dysolve AI begins by assessing the user's linguistic abilities through their responses to a series of short, interactive games. Upon identifying specific linguistic deficits, the Dysolve AI model generates personalized follow-up games designed to target and remediate those issues. Each session serves as a continuous learning opportunity for the AI, enabling it to refine its approach and create an evolving game-based remediation strategy tailored to the individual needs of each user.
## Landscape

1.  ### Company Field:
    - EduNational is in the field of education (EdTech) and healthcare.  The company focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) for diagnosing and treating language-related disorders such as dyslexia and other related conditions.  [Education technology](https://builtin.com/edtech) is a growing field that incorporates information technology in the classroom to create a customized and engaging learning environment. 
1.  ### Major Industry Trends:
    - Over the past decade students suspected of having reading disability have been required to be [screened for dyslexia](https://observer.com/2024/09/new-yorks-dyslexia-bill-how-ai-can-transform-special-education-and-save-billions/) to enroll in limited special education programs.  However, since schools are also required to administer quarterly reading assessments, a better solution would be to provide intervention for students performing in the bottom third on standardized tests.
    - [Human linguistics is a complex, interlocking system](https://observer.com/2024/09/new-yorks-dyslexia-bill-how-ai-can-transform-special-education-and-save-billions/) that requires constant encoding and decoding during the communication process.  It is nearly impossible to detect a deficit in this process through human intervention.  However, the adoption of AI in educational tools has revolutionized personalized learning experiences, making real-time assessment and customized lesson plans possible.  
    > "In recent years, AI’s ability to find patterns and develop personalized treatments and solutions has surpassed the skills of human practitioners." - [Digital Wealth News](https://dwealth.news/2024/08/ai-education-can-ai-really-dissolve-dyslexia/)
    
1.  ### Main Competitors:
    - [Carnegie Learning - FastForWard](https://www.carnegielearning.com/solutions/literacy-ela/fast-forword/)
    - [LiteracyPlanet](https://www.literacyplanet.com/)
    - [Brainware Learning - Brainware Safari](https://mybrainware.com/brainware-safari/)
    - [Blast Off Into Reading](https://blastofftolearning.com/blast-off-to-reading)

## Results

1.  ### Business Impact:
    - EduNational has significantly influenced the education and healthcare sectors since its transition into an AI firm, achieving notable success despite being relatively small. It has reported between 1 to 5 million annual revenues since inception, despite having only 18 employees. EduNational continues to bring social awareness to the financial burden that outdated screening policies are placing on families and school districts.  For instance, Ortan Gillingham (OG/MLS) is a popular dyslexia intervention program, in the U.S.  In some states teachers are required to receive special training and certifications in this method, despite the lack of evidence to support the long-term efficacy of the program.  Dysolve has positioned itself as a cost-effective solution that can transform the Special Education system.  Case studies have proven academic performance gains within two months of program completion, at [1% of the cost per student in New York](https://observer.com/2024/09/new-yorks-dyslexia-bill-how-ai-can-transform-special-education-and-save-billions/), and under 10% of special education cost in state funding.

1.  ### Core Success Metrics:
    - According to [Zippia](https://www.zippia.com/carnegie-learning-careers-1012517/revenue/), the key financial metrics for Carnegie Learning's performance are peak revenue and revenue per employee ratio.  Although [EduNational's 2.6m in revenue](https://zi-lite.zoominfo.com/#/profile/company/1334565411/overview) is a fraction of Carnegie Learning's 22.4m 2023 revenue, EduNational's revenue per employee outperforms Carnegie Learning, which emphasizes its efficiency and impact relative to its size.  Carnegie Learning's revenue per 615 employees is 36,439, while EduNational's revenue per [18 employees](https://www.zoominfo.com/c/edunational-llc/1334565411) is 145k.

1.  ### Industry Performance:
    - EduNational is performing well in the intelligent systems field with a reported 2.6 million in revenue for 2023.  In terms of overall profits EduNational is ranked third place in comparison to top competitors, such as [Carnegie Learning with 22.4m](https://www.zippia.com/carnegie-learning-careers-1012517/revenue/) and [LiteracyPlanet with 4.7m](https://zi-lite.zoominfo.com/#/profile/company/354456212/overview) in reported revenue.
    - Despite its relatively small market share, EduNational has managed to distinguish itself from Carnegie Learning, by emphasizing its dynamic game-based approach to detection and treatment, which creates a personalized treatment plan.
## Recommendations

1.  ### Products and Services Expansion:
    - EduNational should consider expanding to become the leader in special education intervention from K-12.  As such, it should include products that address crossover conditions like dyscalculia and dysgraphia. According to the [Teaching Channel](https://www.teachingchannel.com/k12-hub/blog/dyslexia-dysgraphia-dyscalculia-difference/#:~:text=What%20Is%20Dyscalculia%3F,students%20with%20this%20learning%20difference), challenges in symbol recognition, language processing, and communication are common among dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia. Consequently, overlapping teaching strategies may be effective in assisting students with these related conditions.
        - [`Dyscalculia`](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/learning-disabilities/Pages/Types-of-Learning-Problems.aspx): "A math learning disability characterized by difficulty in understanding and working with mathematical concepts and quantities."
        - [`Dysgraphia`](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/learning-disabilities/Pages/Types-of-Learning-Problems.aspx): "A learning disability that affects the physical act of writing, which can also impact typing and other fine motor skills."
1.  ### Expansion Benefits:
    -  Expanding into treatments for related conditions would not only generate a new revenue stream, but also strengthen the company's position as a leader in comprehensive AI-based learning support.
1.  ### Required Technologies for Expansion:
    - The product would not require any new technologies, instead it would be an extension of the current technology to improve cognitive processes for a different type of disorder.  However, additional research would be required to identify appropriate evaluation and remediation metrics for different conditions.
1.  ### Assumptions:
    - Dysolve has proven itself to be an effective tool to identify deficiencies in linguistic processes, by targeting underlying issues.  It can be reasonably assumed that a similar approach would be just as effective in correcting problems with fine motor skills, in addition to spatial and numerical reasoning.
