# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company : Disolve AI

* When was the company incorporated? EduNational LLC was incorporated in New York in 2007 as a certified MWOSB (minority women-owned small business), to fill the needs of neurodiverse students.  In 2017 the company broadened its services to individuals with dyslexia with the Dysolve Program.

* Who are the founders of the company?  EduNational LLC was originally founded in 2007 by Dr. Coral PS Hoh as a consultancy to address the needs neurodiverse individuals.  However, in 2017 Dr. Hoh partnered with co-founder Evan Haruta to transition the company into an AI firm.  As a result of this transition, the company was able to broaden its services to individuals with dyslexia, by creating the Dysolve Program.  

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The idea for Dysolve came from Dr. Hoh's 30 years or research in the treatment of neurological conditions.  As a consultancy, EduNational designed and evaluated intervention programs for neurodiverse individuals in upstate New York and Hudson Valley.  It was during this time that Dr. Hoh began to realize the scale to which linguistic problems was disrupting the lives to students and families.  The team at EduNational then began building an autonoumous AI system to address a variety of learning disabilities.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The company is primarily funded by through montlhy subscription from their customers at $222 for the Basic edition and $389 for the premier edition.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Dysolve attempts to identify and correct a learners unique linguistic problems, by desiging a curriculum consisiting of game-based learning acivities, designed to strenthen the neurological pathways that are causing reading difficulties.    

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The software is designed for individuals experiencing difficulty reading, due to dyslexia, and other learning disorders.  Statistics indicate one in five people in the United States have dyslexia.  That accounts for roughly 20% of the U.S. population, which is approximately 66.8 million people.  That is 66.8 million people who read below grade level.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Unlike traditional interventions, Dysolve does not use standard assessement tests to diagnose and treat neurodiverse individuals. Instead, the software designs an interactive verbal game-based activity, that constantly evaluates the language processing ability of an individual student for at least 15 minutes a day.  Once linguistic deficits are identified, the sytem is then able to design new game-based clearning activities to target and correct these issues. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
The company is in the field of education and healthcare.  The company focusses on artificial intelligence for diagnosing and treating language-related disorders such as dyslexia and other related conditions. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
Over the past decade students suspected of having reading disability were required to be screened for dyslexia, in order to be enrolled in limited special education programs.  However, since schools already administer standardized reading assessments on a quarterly basis, a better solution would be to provide intervention for students performing in the bottom third on standardized tests.  In addition, AI embedded intelligent systems can compare an individual's current and previous performance, and evaluate it in relations to their peers.  

Human linguistics is a complex, interlocking systems, that requires constant encoding and decoding during the communciation process.  It is nearly impossible to detect a deficit in this process through manual intervention.  AI embedded systems are not only capable of indentifying deficits in these computationally intense processes, it can also create a customized lesson plan to address the underlying issues.  For instance, AI intelligent systems can effectively interact with a user dynamically and extract relevant data to generate or modify a user model, in order to provide adaptive instruction to that user.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The impact of this company so far has been to bring social awareness to the financial burden that outdated policies are placing on families and school districts.  For instance, Ortan Gillingham is a popular dyslexia intervention program in the U.S. that focuses on phonological awareness.  In fact, teachers are mandated to receive OG/MSL training or certifications is some states, although there is no evidence that supports the long-term efficacy of this program.  Alternatively, Dysolve case studies have demonstrated language processing improvements with weekly intervention.  Once the user reaches 90 to 100% efficiency in core areas, improvements in spelling test, and standardized testing is achieved. It has also proven its cost effectiveness at just 1% of the cost of special ed per student in New York, and under 10% of what states spend.
